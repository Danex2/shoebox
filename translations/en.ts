  q1: "What exactly is warcraftguilds?",
  q1a: `Warcraftguilds is a tool I made in my spare time to make it easier to find a guild in world of warcraft. The current systems are okay if you just want to jump into a random guild but I wanted to provide ways to filter even further to help people find a guild that matches them perfectly.`,
