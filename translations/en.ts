  q1: "What exactly is warcraftguilds?",
  q1a: `Warcraftguilds is a tool I made in my spare time to make it easier to find a guild in world of warcraft. The current systems are okay if you just want to jump into a random guild but I wanted to provide ways to filter even further to help people find a guild that matches them perfectly.`,
  q2: "Can I request X feature?",
  q2a: ` I'm not taking feature requests currently because I want to focus on making sure the website is usable and accessible to everyone.`,

          saved are your discord username, the email you used to sign up to
          discord and your discord avatar image) we do not store anything else
          related to your discord account and will never send you emails.`,
